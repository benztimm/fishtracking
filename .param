**CSRT Tracker**: 
- **Foundation**: Employs Discriminative Correlation Filter with Channel 
    and Spatial Reliability to adjust the filter's response 
    based on spatial reliability.
- **Implementation**: The tracker uses features like HoGs 
    (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) and color attributes to 
    improve tracking accuracy, especially for non-rectangular objects.
- **Trade-offs**: Provides higher accuracy but at the cost of a 
    lower frame rate compared to some other trackers.

**KCF Tracker**: 
- **Foundation**: Stands for Kernelized Correlation Filters. 
    This tracker expands on the ideas of BOOSTING and MIL with the computational efficiency 
    of Fast Fourier Transforms.
- **Implementation**: Utilizes properties of circulant matrices, allowing all shifts of 
    a sample to be represented, enabling faster detection through correlation.
- **Trade-offs**: Faster and more accurate than BOOSTING and MIL, but it 
    still struggles with full occlusions and significant scale changes.

**MIL Tracker**: 
- **Foundation**: Improves upon BOOSTING by using Multiple Instance Learning 
    (MIL) to reduce the risk of drifting.
- **Implementation**: Instead of treating all non-object regions as 
    negatives, MIL allows some to be ambiguous, which helps in cases 
    where the object is partially occluded.
- **Trade-offs**: Better at handling occlusions compared to BOOSTING 
    but is still not robust against full occlusions 
    and might have slower response times.

    featureSetNumFeatures: 250
    samplerSearchWinSize: 25.0
    samplerTrackInRadius: 4.0

Possible metrics:
IoU: Intersection over Union
False Positive Rate: area of false positive / area of tracker
Distance: distance between center of tracker and center of object (already in the code)
time: time to process all frames (already in the code) might change to time per frame
percent of frames overflowing: number of frames where the tracker is overflowing / total number of frames
percent of failed frames: number of frames where the tracker failed / total number of frames
